# Lead Generation Analytics: Data-Driven Insights for Strategic Growth  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **lead generation trends** for e-learning programs using a **synthetically generated dataset of 10,000+ entries**. It provides **data-driven insights** to optimize marketing strategies, improve targeting, and allocate budgets effectively.  

## 📊 Key Objectives  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, standardizing, and structuring the dataset for accurate analysis.  
- **Demographic Analysis**: Identifying lead trends by location, college, and year of study.  
- **Program Analysis**: Evaluating interest levels in various e-learning programs.  
- **Projections & Predictions**: Estimating lead conversion rates and suggesting budget allocation.  
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Presenting findings using **Power BI** and **Excel** dashboards.  

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing Steps  
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Filled missing categorical values with "Unknown" or the most frequent value.  
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated redundant rows using unique identifiers (`Lead ID`).  
3. **Standardizing Text Data**: Ensured uniformity (e.g., `"delhi"` → `"Delhi"`).  
4. **Correcting Logical Mismatches**: Mapped colleges to the correct locations.  
5. **Encoding Data**: Converted categorical variables for analysis (e.g., `1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th`).  
6. **Validating Dataset**: Ensured a **realistic distribution** of leads across key attributes.
